# 2015-Capstone-Project

This project was part of my education at ITT Technical Institute to connect a collection of asp.net pages to a MySql database. 

My task list included working on C# pages, converting html to asp.net, and researching better solutions for the project than what we had. I think it came out rather well, there's a list of bugs I've found and haven't had time to work on.
